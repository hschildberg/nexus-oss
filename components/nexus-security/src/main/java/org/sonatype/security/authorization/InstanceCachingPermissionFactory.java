/**
 * Permission factory that delegates to another factory, and caches returned instances keyed by permission string
 * representation into weak map. The trick is, that permissions themself may be considered "static". The application
 * defines them upfront, and they are constant during runtime. The mapping of users to permissions (using different
 * concepts like "roles" or "groups") are volatile, but this factory has nothing to do with mapping, and even then, the
 * mapped permissions are still constants.
